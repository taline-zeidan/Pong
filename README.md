# Pong

A simple pong game.
This is a pong game that I created as a part of day 22 of the 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu.
Here's how it works:
We have an 800x600 pixel black screen.
We have two paddles, one right and one left. They only move vertically.
To move the right paddle, use the up and down arrow keys.
To move the left paddle, use the w and s keys.
There seems to be a problem with long-pressing any of these keys on my computer. I can only move the paddles bit by bit.
The ball starts at the center of the screen and moves upwards to the top right.
Upon collision with the top and bottom walls, as well as any of the paddles, the ball bounces off and reverses direction.
Upon collision with the left or right walls, the player on the opposite side gets a point.
